# aiha

**aiha** is the kesh word for _new_.

A dataflow language inspired by Tesler and Enea's [Compel](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/l1m4wr/a_language_design_for_concurrent_processes/) from 1968 and [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) from 1986.

Its syntax is a superset of [na](https://github.com/kesh-lang/na).
